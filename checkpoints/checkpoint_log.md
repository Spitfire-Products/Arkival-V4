- **Version**: 1.1.0 (matches changelog entry)
- **Features**: Recent development progress with enhancement changes
- **Status**: Active development - automated checkpoint
- **Type**: Automated checkpoint

### Recent Changes
- MAJOR REFACTOR COMPLETED: Arkival Subdirectory Deployment System - Implemented universal path resolution across all 5 Python scripts. Added find_arkival_paths() function for automatic detection of deployment context. System now supports non-destructive integration where Arkival operates from /Arkival subdirectory with only arkival_config.json in project root. Updated 12+ file operations in agent_workflow_orchestrator.py to use resolved paths. Validated all scripts work correctly in both source and subdirectory contexts. Created comprehensive documentation.
