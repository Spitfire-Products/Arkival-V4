      "description": "Fixed critical GitHub deployment architecture issue where environment-specific files were included in repository: 1) Enhanced .gitignore to exclude .replit, .vscode/, .gitpod.yml, and .workflow_system/ directories, 2) Modified setup_workflow_system.py to properly generate .replit file with integrated workflows (not just backup toml), 3) Updated SETUP_GUIDE.md to clearly explain the environment-specific file generation design, 4) Documented clean repository approach where IDE-specific files are generated locally during setup but excluded from GitHub, 5) Ensured cross-platform compatibility where each user gets appropriate environment configuration without repository clutter or merge conflicts",
