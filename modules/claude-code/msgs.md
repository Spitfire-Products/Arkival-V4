REMOVED: 15 redundant test files (test_*, *_test.py, execute_*, working_*, etc.). ORGANIZED: All Claude-specific files moved to modules/claude-integration/ - 19 Python files, 14 documentation files, 3 config files, 3 shell scripts (43 total). ROOT DIRECTORY: Now contains only 5 Python files (claude_delegate.py, collaborative_session.py, msg.py, setup_workflow_system.py, validate_deployment.py) and 9 core documentation files. BATCH DELEGATION: Fully operational via 'python claude_delegate.py <command>' - fixed status display errors. Created DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for navigation. Clean separation achieved between core Arkival and Claude integration. System ready for production use.
