# Contributing to Arkival

*Generated by: codebase_summary/update_project_summary.py - Dynamic contributing guidelines*

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Arkival enables seamless knowledge transfer between AI agents and human developers across different development environments.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Run the setup script: `python3 setup_workflow_system.py`
4. Test your changes with: `python3 validate_deployment.py`

## Development Process

### Setting up the Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone {your-repository-url}
cd arkival

# Run the setup
python3 setup_workflow_system.py

# Validate the setup
python3 validate_deployment.py
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## File Generation Best Practices

### Generator Attribution Requirements

**All generated or updated files MUST include generator attribution to prevent development token waste.** This rule applies to any file that is created or modified by Python scripts.

#### For JSON Files
Add `_generator` field as the first property:
```json
{
  "_generator": "Generated by script_name.py - Brief description of purpose",
  "other_data": "..."
}
```

#### For Markdown Files  
Add generator attribution in the header or footer:
```markdown
# Document Title

Content here...

*Generated by: script_name.py - Brief description of purpose*
```

#### Implementation in Python Scripts
When writing files, always include generator information:

```python
# For JSON files
data_with_generator = {
    "_generator": "Generated by my_script.py - Purpose description",
    **existing_data
}
json.dump(data_with_generator, file, indent=2)

# For Markdown files
content = f"""# Title
Content here...

*Generated by: my_script.py - Purpose description*
"""
```

#### Current Generator Registry
- `setup_workflow_system.py` → `workflow_config.json`, `changelog_summary.json`
- `codebase_summary/update_project_summary.py` → `codebase_summary.json`, `missing_breadcrumbs.json`, `CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `update_changelog.py` → `changelog_summary.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- `agent_workflow_orchestrator.py` → `session_state.json`, `agent_handoff.json`

### Why This Matters
- **Token Efficiency**: Prevents wasted development time searching for file origins
- **Debugging**: Quickly identify which script to modify when issues arise
- **Maintenance**: Understand file relationships and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting codebase with clear data flow
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Validate the setup: `python3 validate_deployment.py`
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Commit your changes with clear messages

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include breadcrumb documentation using `@codebase-summary:` format

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Test across different IDE environments when possible

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add or update docstrings
- Include examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md following semantic versioning

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Submit a pull request
3. Describe your changes clearly
4. Link any related issues

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors

## Questions?

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Start a discussion for general questions
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
