### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Configuration**: JSON-based workflow configuration
- **Documentation**: Markdown with Mermaid diagrams
- **Package Management**: NPM/Poetry templates for different environments

## Key Components

### 1. Workflow Orchestration
- **Agent Handoff System**: Seamless transitions between AI agents and developers
- **Session State Management**: Preserves context across development sessions
- **Version Correlation**: Synchronizes versions across all project components

### 2. Documentation System
- **Breadcrumb Documentation**: Standardized `@codebase-summary:` format throughout codebase
- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Creates comprehensive project summaries
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Auto-generated Mermaid diagrams for system visualization

### 3. WebSocket Mitigation
- **Custom Vite Client**: Blocks WebSocket connections that cause promise rejections
- **React Error Boundary**: Comprehensive error handling for development environment
- **Template Integration**: Ready-to-use templates for common frameworks

### 4. Multi-Environment Support

- **AI Assistant Integration**: Compatible with Cline, Cursor AI, and other coding assistants
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Real-time message system for Claude instance collaboration
- **Batch Job Delegation**: Production-ready system for consistent task delegation to Claude with priority management and result tracking

## Data Flow

### Agent Session Flow
1. **Incoming Workflow**: Loads previous session context and unresolved issues
2. **Development Session**: Maintains real-time documentation and change tracking
3. **Outgoing Workflow**: Documents session progress and prepares handoff

### Documentation Generation
1. **Codebase Analysis**: Scans all files for functions, components, and architecture
2. **Enhanced Features**: Detects AI integrations, database schemas, and performance metrics
3. **Version Management**: Increments versions and maintains historical records

## External Dependencies

### Required Python Libraries
- Standard library modules: `json`, `os`, `shutil`, `sys`, `platform`, `subprocess`, `pathlib`, `datetime`
- Type hints: `typing.Dict`, `typing.Any`, `typing.List`, `typing.Optional`
- No external package dependencies required

### Optional Integrations
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL, SQLite (via Drizzle detection)
- **Frontend Frameworks**: React, Vue, Svelte (auto-detected)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Webpack, Parcel (auto-configured)

## Deployment Strategy

### Setup Process
1. **Package Deployment**: Copy workflow export package to target project
2. **Environment Detection**: Auto-detect IDE and configure accordingly
3. **Enhanced Setup**: Run `python3 setup_workflow_system.py` for basic setup
4. **AI Configuration**: Use AI agent to analyze project and update `workflow_config.json`
5. **Validation**: Run `python3 validate_deployment.py` to ensure readiness

### Configuration Management
- **Generic Template**: Setup creates template requiring AI agent customization
- **Technology Stack Detection**: AI agent identifies and configures project-specific settings
- **Cross-Platform Optimization**: Automatically adapts to different development environments

### Quality Assurance
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive multi-language function detection validation
- **Integration Testing**: Full workflow validation and language scan test coverage
- **Deployment Validation**: Pre-deployment checks ensure system readiness
- **Documentation Organization**: Consolidated from 22 to 8 root files with organized reference directory

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

Documentation Workflow Clarification:
- Codebase summaries: Run frequently to track function documentation and breadcrumb coverage (independent of versioning)
- Changelogs: Run infrequently for major changes, agent handoffs, and milestone documentation (version-controlled evolution)
- These are two separate systems serving different purposes and update frequencies

Inter-Agent Communication Status (Production Ready):
- Direct subprocess communication confirmed working (bypasses bash tool timeouts)
- Python subprocess.check_output() provides reliable inter-agent communication
- Authentication bridge functional with OAuth solution (unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Multiple fallback methods: direct execution → sh → dash → message coordination
- Claude CLI OAuth authenticated, credentials valid until June 17, 2025
- Comprehensive communication engine with automatic method selection
- Collaborative session manager for structured development workflows
- System deployed and ready for extended collaborative development sessions
