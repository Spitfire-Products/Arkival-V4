Current documentation is excessive, overly verbose, and overlapping - causing information bloat rather than providing clear guidance. Next session should streamline README.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, AGENT_GUIDE.md, DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md while maintaining essential information for quick agent onboarding.",
